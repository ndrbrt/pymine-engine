## Installation

```

## Usage

A backend engine to implement the Minesweeper game in Python(3). It computes the logic behind the game and exposes an API that you can use to build your frontend.

Here is a simple example of the usage:

```python
>>> from pymine import Game
>>> g = Game(9,9,10)
>>> g.start(5,5)
>>> print(g)
```

The code above initialize a Game object `g`, with a board that has 9 rows, 9 columns (then 81 cells) and 10 bombs.

After that, it starts the game on cell with coordinates (5,5) that is row 5, column 5. The `start` method compiles the board to have a "zero cell" in the given coordinates, then uncovers that cell and its neighbors (more details on this below).

The third statement prints the game, that is it prints the board with the actual uncovered or flagged cells. Note: this utility is mostly useful when using the package interactively in a shell, mainly for debug purposes. (If you actually want to display the board, showing all the cells' values either they are covered or uncovered, you can do so with `print(g.board)`)

Once the game is started, you have three possible actions you can accompish: uncover a cell, mark it as a bomb cell, or mark it as doubt.

The following two methods mark a cell as "bomb" or as "doubt" respectively

```python
>>> g.mark_cell_as_bomb(7,6)
>>> g.mark_cell_as_doubt(8,6)
```

If you now print the game (`print(g)`), you would see an "f" (for "flagged") on cell (7,6) and a "?" on cell (8,6). (Remember the coordinates of a cell are in the form or (row, column), as in a matrix)

To uncover a cell, just use

```python
>>> g.uncover_cell(7,7)
```

Now, marking a cell, actually, is just helpful for whom is playing the game, but has nothing to do with logic of the game itself.
On the contrary, the action for uncover a cell is a key action that can determine if we win or lost. Every time we uncover a cell we could end up winning the game (if we correctly uncovered all the cells that are not bombs) or loosing it (if we uncover a cell that is actually a bomb).

Because of this, every time you uncover a cell, you should check the game. Do so with

```python
>>> g.check()
```

The `check()` method, returns None if the game is neither win nor lost (i.e. is not over yet), or an Outcome object otherwise.
To know if the game is over and if it's win or lost you can look at the returning value of this method, or you can just check Game object's `is_over` attribute, that is `True` when the game is actually over, and the `outcome` attribute.

```python
>>> check = g.check()
>>> if check is not None: print(f'* Outcome: {check.name} *')
```

```python
>>> check()
>>> if g.is_over: print(f'* Outcome: {g.outcome.name} *')
```

## API

### Game

To instantiate a Game object with a number of rows, columns and bombs passed as parameters: `Game(rows, columns, bombs)`.
Once you have a Game object instantiated, you can call the following methods and attributes:

#### Methods

- `start(row, column)`
Starts the game within the cell located at coordinates (`row`, `column`). That means it creates a board that, at those coordinates, has a cell whose value is 0 (i.e. all of its 8 neighbors are **not** bombs); it sets the attribute `start_time` at the current time and finally calls the `uncover_cell` method, passing the actual cell's coordinates as parameters.

- `uncover_cell(row, column)`
Sets a cell's status as uncovered (where cell is the cell located at coordinates (`row`, `column`), and *uncovered* refers to `Status.UNCOVERED`).
If the cell's value is 0, then it also uncovers the cell's neighbors. For any of the uncovered neighbors whose value is 0, its neighbors are uncovered too and so on, recursively.
Returns `None` if there's no cell at the given coordinates or if the cell is already uncovered; otherwise a list with all of the uncovered cells (the current one and all of the uncovered neighbors, if any).

- `mark_cell_as_bomb(row, column)`
Sets a cell's status as `Status.MARKED_BOMB` (if the cell has not been uncovered already).
Returns the cell.

- `mark_cell_as_doubt(row, column)`
Sets a cell's status as `Status.MARKED_DOUBT` (if the cell has not been uncovered already).
Returns the cell.

- `unmark_cell(row, column)`
Sets a cell's status just as `Status.COVERED` (if the cell has not been uncovered already).
Returns the cell.

- `check()`
Checks if the game is either win or lost. If so, it sets the attributes `end_time` to the current time, `outcome` to an Outcome object representig the actual outcome and `is_over` to `True`.
Returns `None` if the game is not over (neither win nor lost); `Outcome.WIN` if the game is win; `Outcome.LOST` if the game is lost.

#### Attributes

- `rows`
Number of rows in the game's board.

- `cols`
Number or columns in the game's board.

- `number_of_bombs`
Number of bombs in the game's board.

- `uncovered_cells`
List of cell's whose status is `Status.UNCOVERED`.

- `is_over`
`True` if the game has been win or lost; `False` otherwise.

- `outcome`
`None` if the game is not over; `Outcome.WIN` or `Outcome.LOST` otherwise.

- `board`
An instance of the Board class, representing the actual game's board.


## Example

This is a very minimal and trivial example that implements an actual playable game of Minesweeper using this api.

```python
# example.py

from pymine import Game

help = '''
*==================================================*
|                                                  |
|                     PyMine                       |
|                                                  |
*==================================================*

How to play:

- Write the coordinates of the cell you want to
  uncover, when asked for "Your move".
  Example:
  >>> Your move: 5,5

- If you want to flag a cell to mark it as bomb,
  use a third argument "f" (ex: 5,5,f).
  To unflag it, use "u".
'''


def main():
    print(help)

    # Start the game
    g = Game(9,9,10)
    starting_cell = input('Your move: ').split(',')
    row, col = int(starting_cell[0]), int(starting_cell[1])
    g.start(row, col)
    print(g)

    # Play
    while True:
        next_move = input('Your move: ').split(',')
        row, col = int(next_move[0]), int(next_move[1])
        action = ''
        if len(next_move) == 3:
            action = next_move[2]
        
        if action == 'f':
            g.mark_cell_as_bomb(row, col)
        elif action == 'u':
            g.unmark_cell(row, col)
        else:  # the default action is to uncover the cell
            g.uncover_cell(row, col)
            g.check()
        print(g)

        # if we win or lost g.is_over becomes True
        if g.is_over:
            print('* Game is over *')
            print(f'* Outcome: {g.outcome.name} *')
            break


if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()

```

You can play it with:

```shell
$ python3 example.py
```
